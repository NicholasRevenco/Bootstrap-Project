# Bootstrap-Project

Requirement 1:
  Grid (in index.html)

Requirement 2:
  Navbar (in index.html and in history.html)

Requirement 3:
  Flexible elements:
    Cards (in index.html) Test
    Jumbotron (in index.html)
    Table (in history.html)
    Alert (in history.html)
    Collapse (in history.html)

Requirement 4:
  Open elements:
  Toast (in index.html)
  Offcanvas (in index.html within the toast element)

Popover Extra-Credit:
  A new link to the popovers are needed (JavaScript link is required while CSS link is not)
  With the actual button regarding the popover, nothing needs to be changed than what is seen and provided on the W3Schools tutorial
  The JavaScript script in the file has to be after the button popover for some reason (does not work when the script is before)
  I do not know how else to explain how the popover works, but the W3Schools tutorial on popovers does not provide the link to the popover JavaScript that is needed, but the actual script that is in the file is correct
